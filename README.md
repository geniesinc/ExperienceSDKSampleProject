# ExperienceSDKSampleProject

## THIS PROJECT REQUIRES [UNITY 2022.3.32f1](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2022.3.32#installs)

### How to Use this Project

Download the zip or clone the project and add the created folder to Unity Hub.

This project includes various scenes and sample scripts for loading a Genies avatar, using mobile input, and seeing how TypeScript is written.

### Notes:
1. When opening the project in Unity, many errors and warnings will pop up in the console. These don't impact the actual project itself - you can open one of the sample scenes and play, and it should run.
2. This project is usable without having an active Genies account - however, you won't be able to upload a build to playtest unless you are logged in.
